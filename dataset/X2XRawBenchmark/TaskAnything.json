For example, supposed the function is passed this array and size=4:\n\nconst char *strings1[] = {\"Bird\", \"Car\", \"Plane\", \"Bug\"};\nThe function would return 15, which is the sum of the lengths of the four strings (4+3+5+3).\n\nThe Run option will run the program in main.c. You can use that for your own testing purposes as you develop your solution.\n\nHints and Suggestions\nThis task is dealing with both strings and pointers, which have very different sizes.

        "question": "Prompt\n\nWrite a compare and contrast essay as an example. \nImagine that your local library has invited members of your community to submit proposals for a fundraiser. You are the student representative on the committee to choose the best proposal. Read the two proposals below, paying close attention to their similarities and differences. Consider whether or not each proposal is logistically feasible, which fundraiser will most appeal to members of your community, and which fundraiser will likely raise more money. Which proposal do you think the committee should choose? Write an essay in which you make a case for your choice. Support your argument with references to specific details in each proposal.\n\nProposal 1\n\nThe best way to get people invested in the library is to show them the joy of reading. For that reason, the library should hold a book sale. People could donate books that they no longer want, and the librarians could find books that the library no longer needs. Volunteers will need to sort the books into categories and arrange them in an inviting way, like at a bookstore. Books should be inexpensive, so people buy more—maybe fifty cents for paperbacks and two dollars for hardcover books. A book sale would appeal to people of all ages, from little kids to the elderly. There should also be a table where people can sign up for library cards. That way, if visitors don’t find any books they want at the sale, they can come back to the library.\n\nProposal 2\n\nA great way to make money for the library would be by holding a car wash. The softball team at my school raised over $400 dollars at their car wash last year! The car wash could be held in the library parking lot on a Saturday morning. You could ask local high school students to volunteer to wash the cars. That would be a great way to get students involved with the library. It takes two or three volunteers to wash a car quickly, so you would need at least ten volunteers. You could charge around ten dollars per car. Even people who aren’t very interested in reading like to have a clean car, so you would get a lot of people to stop by who might not otherwise come to a library fundraiser."

Compiling quantum circuits for restricted topologies can be formulated as a graph traversal. The quantum circuit consists of computational qubits and gates, and the computer can be represented as a graph (vertices are hardware qubits and the edges represent the two qubit connectivity between the qubits – Qiskit calls it coupling graph). Compiling the circuit to the coupling graph requires introducing SWAP gates. The cost of implementing a circuit gate is expressed as the number of SWAP gates inserted. The total number of SWAPs is the compilation cost.\n\nThe goal is to map the compilation problem to A* where multiple agents are searching in parallel the best solution for adapting the circuit to the coupling graph. The use case is offered by surface code lattice surgery (see Figure).

        "question": "sumamrize this in points. do not leave every key information: \n0:00\nthere are at least three factors that\n0:02\nare going to govern how quickly you\n0:03\ntransition from ingesting food to a\n0:07\nfasted State remember as you ingest your\n0:10\nlast bite or sip of calories that's not\n0:13\nwhen the fast begins your body is still\n0:15\nseeing food you're actually carrying\n0:17\naround food inside of you even though\n0:19\nyou're not putting it into your mouth\n0:21\nyou're still eating in some sense and\n0:24\nthe one meal per day while perhaps ideal\n0:28\nfor certain people's schedules\n0:29\nmay actually cause people to under eat\n0:31\nand in some cases that might be what\n0:33\npeople want they actually want to under\n0:34\neat but when we start thinking about\n0:36\nperformance in work and in sport and\n0:41\nwhen we start considering Hormone Health\n0:43\nand hormone production fertility that's\n0:46\nwhen we can really start to look at the\n0:49\nseven to nine hour feeding window versus\n0:52\nthe four to six hour feeding window\n0:53\nversus the one meal per day type feeding\n0:56\nwindow with some different objectivity\n0:58\nwe can start to look at it through a\n1:00\ndifferent lens because it turns out that\n1:02\nwhen you place the feeding window and\n1:05\nhow long that feeding window is actually\n1:08\nwill impact a number of other things in\n1:10\nparticular hormones that can be very\n1:12\nimportant for a number of things related\n1:14\nto sex and reproduction can be related\n1:17\nto\n1:18\nperformance at work performance in\n1:21\nathleticism and there are excellent\n1:23\nstudies on this so let's talk about some\n1:25\nconditions where having the feeding\n1:27\nwindow early in the day would actually\n1:29\nbe very beneficial\n1:30\nthere was a study that was published\n1:32\nrecently in cell reports again cell\n1:34\nPress Journal excellent Journal\n1:35\npeer-reviewed\n1:37\nthat looked at\n1:39\nthe distribution of protein intake\n1:42\nin different meals\n1:44\ndelivered either early in the day or\n1:46\nlater in the day and I'm summarizing\n1:48\nhere quite a lot but I should mention\n1:50\nthat this study was performed in both\n1:52\nmice and humans same paper mice and\n1:55\nhumans and involved hypertrophy training\n1:59\nessentially increasing the weight\n2:02\nbearing of given limbs to try and induce\n2:04\nhypertrophy which is the growth of\n2:06\nmuscle tissue\n2:09\nit does appear that muscle tissue is\n2:12\nbetter able to undergo hypertrophy by\n2:16\nvirtue of the fact that there's better\n2:19\nor enhanced protein synthesis early in\n2:21\nthe day because of the expression of one\n2:24\nof these particular clock genes called B\n2:25\nMal bmal\n2:28\nBML regulates a number of different\n2:30\nprotein synthesis Pathways within muscle\n2:33\ncells such that eating protein early in\n2:37\nthe day supports muscle tissue\n2:39\nmaintenance and or growth and in this\n2:42\nstudy they also looked at the effects of\n2:44\nsupplementing so-called BCAAs branched\n2:46\nchain amino acids Which is popular in\n2:49\nbodybuilding circles and in strength\n2:51\ntraining circles and BCAAs are essential\n2:54\ncomponents of\n2:55\na number of different foods but can also\n2:58\nbe supplemented\n2:59\nthe takeaway of the study is pretty\n3:01\nstraightforward however the takeaway is\n3:03\nif your main interest is maintaining and\n3:05\nor building muscle\n3:07\nthen it can be beneficial to ingest\n3:09\nprotein early in the day you would still\n3:12\nwant to obey this\n3:14\nwhat we're calling a kind of\n3:15\nfoundational rule of no not eating any\n3:18\nfood for the first hour post waking or\n3:21\nat least the first hour post waking\n3:22\nlet's say you wake up at 7am your main\n3:25\ninterest is in\n3:27\nhypertrophy or maintenance of muscle\n3:29\nthen you would want to ingest some\n3:30\nprotein sometime before 10 a.m but\n3:32\nobviously if you're interested in\n3:34\ngetting the health effects of\n3:35\nintermittent fasting that you wouldn't\n3:37\ningest any food for at least the first\n3:40\n60 Minutes upon waking now it's not as\n3:43\nif at 1001 am a gate slam shut and you\n3:46\ncan't generate hypertrophy of course\n3:48\nthat's not the case\n3:50\nhowever it's very interesting that it\n3:52\ndoesn't matter when the resistance\n3:53\ntraining the load-bearing exercise\n3:56\noccurs in the 24-hour cycle\n3:58\nso whether or not in other words people\n4:00\nare training early in the day or they're\n4:02\ntraining late in the day\n4:04\nit still appears that ingesting protein\n4:06\nearly in the day favors hypertrophy so\n4:09\nif you're somebody who's mainly\n4:10\nconcerned with muscle maintenance and\n4:11\nhypertrophy then it may make sense to\n4:15\nmove that feeding window earlier in the\n4:17\nday but if you are somebody who's\n4:19\ninterested in deriving the many clearly\n4:22\nestablished health effects of time\n4:24\nrestricted feeding and you are somebody\n4:26\nwho would like to maintain or build\n4:29\nmuscle\n4:30\nthen ingesting proteins in the early\n4:34\npart of the day would be important to\n4:36\nyou when you eat there's some period of\n4:38\ntime afterwards in which you're actually\n4:39\nstill eating at least from the\n4:41\nperspective of metabolism because\n4:43\nglucose is up insulin is up\n4:45\nand you're undergoing different\n4:47\nmetabolic and digestive processes that\n4:50\ndon't really speak to you being in a\n4:52\nfasted state right it's not just about\n4:55\nwhen you take your last bite or your\n4:57\nlast sip\n4:58\nhowever there are things that we can do\n5:00\nto accelerate the transition from a Fed\n5:03\nstate\n5:04\nto a fasted State and I want to\n5:09\nemphasize that the term fed state is\n5:12\nprobably a better way to think about it\n5:13\nthan eating or not eating because we\n5:16\nthink of eating as the verb we're eating\n5:18\nwe're eating okay we're done eating I'm\n5:19\nfasting now but you're not actually\n5:21\nfasting because you are fed so we should\n5:24\nreally think about fed and unfed States\n5:27\nbecause from a seller processes\n5:28\nperspective and from a health\n5:30\nperspective that's actually what your\n5:32\nbody and your system are paying\n5:34\nattention to\n5:35\nso there's a fun and exciting concept\n5:37\nrelated to this which is glucose\n5:38\nclearing\n5:40\nyou may have heard the old adage that if\n5:42\nyou take a 20 or 30 minute walk after\n5:45\ndinner that it accelerates the rate at\n5:47\nwhich you digest that food and indeed it\n5:49\ndoes\n5:50\nclearing out of glucose from your system\n5:52\ncan be accomplished through a number of\n5:54\ndifferent means but light movement or\n5:57\nexercise does increase gastric emptying\n6:00\ntime so for instance if you were to eat\n6:03\na meal that ended at 8 pm and just and\n6:07\nthen plop to the couch watch TV or get\n6:10\non your computer or go to sleep\n6:13\nit would be five or six hours until you\n6:16\nhave transitioned from a Fed state to a\n6:19\nfasted State however you can accelerate\n6:21\nthat considerably by taking a 20 or 30\n6:24\nminute just Light walk it doesn't have\n6:27\nto be speed walking it certainly doesn't\n6:28\nhave to be jogging but just walking\n6:30\noutside or moving around\n6:32\nlet's take a look at what high intensity\n6:34\ntraining of any kind does to blood\n6:36\nglucose because in this case it turns\n6:38\nout that when you do high intensity\n6:40\ntraining actually has opposite effects\n6:43\non blood glucose depending on whether or\n6:45\nnot you do it early or later in the day\n6:46\nwhen you look at the studies that have\n6:49\nexplored high intensity interval\n6:51\ntraining and its effect on blood glucose\n6:53\nthere are a couple studies that leap out\n6:55\nfor instance one that emphasized that\n6:57\nblood glucose levels will actually\n6:59\nincrease if high intensity interval\n7:00\ntraining is performed early in the day\n7:02\nand will decrease if high intensity\n7:04\ninterval training is performed later in\n7:07\nthe day\n7:08\nif you have ingested food throughout the\n7:12\nafternoon and evening and late in the\n7:13\nday and you're thinking about going to\n7:14\nsleep and you'd like to enter sleep in a\n7:17\nway that is less fed and more fasted\n7:19\nthen engaging in high intensity interval\n7:22\ntraining in the afternoon will lower or\n7:25\nevening I should say will lower blood\n7:27\nglucose and in that way we'll help you\n7:29\naccelerate your transition into the\n7:31\nfasted state provided you don't ingest\n7:33\nsomething after the high intensity\n7:35\ninterval training light walks after\n7:36\ndinner or any other meal for that matter\n7:38\nor high intensity interval training\n7:40\nprovided it's done in the second half of\n7:42\nthe day can lower blood glucose and\n7:43\nspeed the transition from fed to fasted\n7:46\nStates but I also mention it because\n7:49\nwhat we are really trying to achieve\n7:51\nwhen we partake in intermittent fasting\n7:54\nso-called time-restricted feeding is\n7:57\nwhat we're really trying to do is access\n7:59\nunfed States or fasted States it's not\n8:03\nreally about when you eat and what you\n8:04\ndo it's about extending the duration of\n8:07\nthe fasting period as long as you can in\n8:10\na way that's still compatible with your\n8:12\neating right not the other way around\n8:14\nand this gets back to this key feature\n8:17\nof our biology which is that what we eat\n8:20\nwhen we eat when we exercise when we\n8:22\nview light it's about setting a context\n8:24\nor a set of conditions in your brain and\n8:27\nbody so it's not so much about the\n8:29\nactivities that you undergo it's about\n8:31\nthe activities you undergo and their\n8:33\nrelationship to one another over time\n8:35\nand so in this way it really beautifully\n8:39\nhighlights the way that your biology is\n8:40\ninteracting all the time light is\n8:42\nsetting when you're going to be awakened\n8:43\nwhen you're going to be asleep when you\n8:45\neat is going to be determining when\n8:46\nyou're going to be awake and when you're\n8:47\ngoing to be asleep and when you eat is\n8:50\nalso going to be determining when you\n8:52\nare able to clear out debris from your\n8:55\nbrain and body and repair the various\n8:57\ncells and mechanisms of your body when\n8:59\nyou're able to reduce those inflammatory\n9:01\ncytokines throughout your body and this\n9:04\nis really the beauty of time research\n9:05\nand feeding which is it's not really\n9:07\nabout restricting your feet eating it's\n9:09\nabout accessing the beauty of the fasted\n9:11\nstate\n9:12\n[Music]"

During the British colonial era, English was the sole official language until 1974.
